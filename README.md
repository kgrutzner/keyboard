# Custom Split Keyboard
This repository contains all my work for my custom keyboard. This project is for me but I'm happy to take pull requests for improvements. Please find out more at https://karl.grutzner.me

## Keyboard Designs
1. Created a top down version which is printed a key column at a time. This design allows for the Escape key to be in the usual place. Also a very good 
approach for iterative design.
2. Second iteration which will print the key frame in a single print. Will help for stability and also get the best finish in terms of placements of the keys. Not as good for iterating different options.

## Tools
1. FreeCAD
2. Cura
